A) What is the maximum number of consecutive days a customer made purchases?

select cust_id, max(countt) as max_consecutive_days from (
select cust_id, count(leadd) as countt from
(Select cust_id, calendar_dt,
lead(calendar_dt) over (partition by cust_id order by calendar_dt) as leadd
from customer_data)
where leadd - calendar_dt = 1
group by cust_id)
group by cust_id;




B) On average, how many days/transactions does it take a customer to reach a spent threshold of 250 L.E?

select avg (num_transactions) from
(Select cust_id, count (*) as num_transactions
from (
  select cust_id, calendar_dt, amt_le, 
         sum(amt_le) over (partition by cust_id order by calendar_dt) as cumulative_sum
  from customer_data
)
where cumulative_sum >= 250
group by cust_id);
